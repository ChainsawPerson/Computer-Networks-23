# Protocol IPv4 and Fragmentation

### General comments from me:
For me this set was a bit more fun than the previous ones and we used the ***ping*** command quite a lot.

You can do parts 1-3 at home but for part 4 you have to use the Lab PCs so I suggest you at least record what you need there and solve the rest at home.
