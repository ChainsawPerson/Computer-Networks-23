# __Encapsulation_Layers__
###### [Back](/)

For all parts of the excercise I used my laptop connected to the lab WiFi,
but the lab computers should work fine as well.

# Useful Links:
- [Internet Archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20220127175142/http:/networksorcery.com/enp/default.htm): Useful but it took *quite some time* to connect. Be patient I guess :)

## PS: I have attached my Wireshark saves for parts [1-2](askhsh1_laptop_WiFi_sxolhs.pcapng) and [3-4](askhsh3_laptop_wifi_sxolhs_v2.pcapng).
Haven't added the file for the last question in the last part ~~(but it shouldn't really matter anyways lol)~~.

### General comments from me:
This set took me WAY too long to understand ~~wth is happening~~ what I should be looking for and "translate" the data to make sense.

The link above should be very helpful along with the theory in the [lab pdf file](Lab2.pdf). You probably won't need any other external sources.
