# __Intro to Wireshark__
###### [Back](Computer-Networks-23)

**Warning:** Lab computers may be useless for the first and second parts of the excercise. 

Personal Recommendation (choose one of these):
- Bring your laptop with you
- Only do part 3 on the lab computer and send it to yourself (or store it in a USB flash or smth)
- Download a game on your phone and play / Stare at the ceiling until you can leave

*For parts 1 and 2:* I used my personal computer running Windows 10

*For part 3:* Uni lab computer

**Commands may differ for Linux/Unix and MacOS**
