## Important:
For this set you will need to be connected to the NTUA subnet, either via the PCLab PCs or via WiFi

I used VPN [(provided by NTUA)](https://www.noc.ntua.gr/help/VPN) and I hope they don't mind, so the risk is yours :)

### General Comments from me:
I have included the image you will have to compare, but honestly ~~I can't make out shit~~ the definition is really
bad when zooming in and the letters are too small so I trusted my seniors' work
[(which you can also find on github)](https://github.com/search?q=computer%20networks%20ntua&type=repositories)
